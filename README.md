# About iro / 色

色 (iro) means color in Japanese.

iro started a collor palette app that began as a recap project during my Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische in October 2024.

This project marks my first experience developing a React app from scratch. I embraced the opportunity to apply all my at the time to develop my first component architecture and front-end logics.

As continue to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and React, I regulary revisit this project to incorporate new concentps and improve its functionality.

Working on iro taught me valuable lessions about long-term project maintanence and continous improvement. What started as a learning exercise has developed into a platfrom for implementing new features and refining intial design decisions.
