# About iro / 色 

色 (iro) is japanese for color.

iro started is a Color palette app. I first developed it as a recap project in my Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische.

This was my first time for me to develop a React frontend on my own. So, naturally, I made design choices which were not always optimal and which somehtimes caused bugs in the long run. As I keep learning more about JavaScript and React I also revisit this project to apply my new knowledge to improve the app.

Working on this project continously already taught me valuable lessons about maintaining a project in the long run. I learned to appreaciate embracing challenges that arise from earlier decisions and to improve upon those.
